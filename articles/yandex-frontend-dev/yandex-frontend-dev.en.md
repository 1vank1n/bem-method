# What you can borrow from Yandex frontend dev

This article is a text version of a [presentation](https://vimeo.com/53219242)
given at [Riga WebConf](http://webconf.lv/) in November 2012.

The article sums up [Yandex](http://www.yandex.com/) over 7-year experience
in finding solutions for efficient frontend development.<br/>
Yandex, as a search engine and the larges Internet company in Russia, enjoys
the maijor share of the local market and provides over a hundred of associated
services with the help of 2500 developers and 150 frontend engineers among them.

Yandex developers jointly produce solutions for the problems they run into. At
the same time, Yandexoids are truly nerds connected to the world outside Yandex
via conferences, hackatons and meetups. So, the solutions produced by Yandex
developers perfectly work outside and can be easily shared.<br/>
Here is a piece of such sharing.

## Web Interface

Look at the draft for an online shop. As you can see, it's nothing special.
Just an ordinary web site providing all the generally accepted possibilities,
such as navigation through the site pages, searching books, some advertising
parts and so on.

As web developers, you know that behind the page there are our dear HTML and CSS.

````js
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>...</head>
        <body>
            ...
        </body>

    body {
        font: 0.8em Arial, sans-serif;
        margin: 0;
        color: black;
    }
    .sidebar ul li {
````

Also, besides the page is really combination of HTML and CSS, it's also a set of
interface pieces.

<img

width="800" height="600" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

Each piece is to do something. It provides to a user a functional or design
point.

Each has its purpose, similar to pieces of furnitureâ€¦<br/>
A chair is to sit on, a cupboard it to keep the kitchen things. A bed is to lay
on, and a coffee machine helps to survive through deadlines.<br/>
You can use furniture to fill our rooms.

Also, you can use interface components to fill pages.

Pages are built with this pieces like houses are build with blocks. So, let's
call them just that, `blocks`.

## Block

A block is an independent interface piece that preserves a design point and some
functionality. Anything that can be taken as a solid piece and can be put into a
page is an interface block.

<table border="0">
  <tr>
      <td colspan="2" align="center">
          <img
          src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5645/14441195.26/0_711d9_9d9c6157_XL.jpg"
          width="800" height="52" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">
          <img
          src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6439/14441195.26/0_711dc_2f5ffa46_M.jpg"
          width="300" height="259" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
      </td>
      <td align="center">
          <img
          src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4122/14441195.26/0_711da_e8f6dee7_M.jpg"
          width="300" height="271" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>
          <img
          src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5634/14441195.26/0_711db_81f5c441_L.jpg"
          width="500" height="47" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Futhermore, some blocks are large. They usually preserve other blocks. But they
still are solid independent pieces.

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">
            <img
            src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4120/14441195.26/0_711dd_3d4b199_XL.jpg"
            width="800" height="77" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img
            src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5647/14441195.26/0_711de_ac603720_M.jpg"
            width="300" height="81" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img
            src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6440/14441195.26/0_711df_12538ac_M.jpg"
            width="300" height="72" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2" align="center">
            <img
            src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5634/14441195.26/0_711db_81f5c441_L.jpg"
            width="500" height="47" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2" align="center">
            <img
            src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4128/14441195.26/0_711e0_8beaa73d_M.jpg"
            width="300" height="33" title="" alt="" border="0"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Here you can see the `Header` block that contains some others.

### Block HTML representation

*Indeed, behind the scenes there are our dear HTML and CSS.*

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5626/14441195.26/0_711e1_e0ab223a_XL.jpg"
width="645" height="46" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

Each block is represented by a piece of HTML markup. To style the block you can
write the CSS rules, as usual.<br/>
`Menu` block is an `ul` tag and its content.

````js
    <ul class="menu">
        <li><a href="/new">New titiles</a></li>
        <li><a href="/soon">Coming soon</a></li>
        <li><a href="/best">Bestsellers</a></li>
        ...
````

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5634/14441195.26/0_711db_81f5c441_L.jpg"
width="500" height="47" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

The same works for the `Search` block, that is represented by `div` tag with
some content.

````js
    <div class="search">
        <input type="text" name="search" value="..."/>
        <input type="button" name="sbmt" value="Search"/>
    </div>
````

The last example is the `Tabbed Pane` block, which is also a combination of HTML
and CSS.

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6439/14441195.26/0_711dc_2f5ffa46_M.jpg"
width="300" height="259" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

````js
    <div class="tabbed-pane">
        <ul>
            <li>Bestsellers</li><li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
           The Casual Vacancy, J.K. Rowling
        </div>
     </div>
````

## Independent CSS blocks
But in order to build pages with blocks, we developers should be sure that these
interface pieces can be put into any place on a page. This can be possible only
if blocks are `independent`.

Block independency means the following.
<blockquote>A block must not be affected by its ancestors, and in its turn must
not affect the descendants.<br/>
Regardless of where this block is placed.</blockquote>

When filling a page with blocks, we developers, shouldn't care where exactly
each block is placed. You just define a set of blocks with the appropriate order.
And that's enough for getting a complete functional page.

````js
    <html>
        <head>..</head>
        <body>

            <div class="head">
                <div class="logo">...</div>
                <ul class="menu">...</ul>
                <div class="search">...</div>
            </div>

            <div class="layout">...</div>

            <div class="foot">...</div>

        </body>
    </html>
````

But, of course, this maybe possible only due to some architectural requirements
to each block. Let us now see what these requirements are. For this let's have a
look at what situations can cause block affection and how to prevent them
beforehand.

### Repeating
The first is repeating blocks.

The same block can appear on the page. For example, one more `Menu` block can be
placed into the `Foot` block.

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4135/14441195.26/0_711e2_5b1a2232_XL.jpg"
width="800" height="600" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

Since now the `Menu` block is not a unique within a page. Because of that you
cannot use `id` selectors to match the CSS rules to it, this would be invalid.

So,
<blockquote>To apply CSS to a block, you should use classname selectors.</blockquote>

**wrong**

````js
    <ul id="menu">
        ...

    #menu {
        ...
````

**right**

````js
    <ul class="menu">
        ...

    .menu {
    ...
````

This rule is correct for any block.<br/>
Even if you think *now* that the block is unique within a page, this can be
changed in the future. So, the best practice is to avoid id selectors at all and
use classes.

### Moving within a Page

The next that can happen with a block is its movement within a page.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/suLQEIcc68g"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As you can see in the video, the `Tabbed Pane` block was moved to he right side
of the page and immediately got broken since it has new ancestors, new parent
DOM nodes now.<br/>
This is that must not happen. You should guarantee that a block will work
correctly in any place on the page.

Actually you can ensure this only by *avoiding cascade in CSS*.

Such a recomendation sounds provocative. But anyway this is reasonable. Now
let's see why.

Cascade is a kind of relations between objects. A cascade rule says that one
object depends on another. It is a connection that can give some benefits.<br/>
But you should have a control over all those connections. If not, this may break
all.

Trying to fix, developers usually add even more connections into the system. That
seems to work at first. But each addition just increase uncontrolable mess.

The more cascade code you bring into the service, we more is risk of future damages.<br/>
So, you should use cascade only when it's really necessary.<br/>

I'll show below the situation when cascade is possible. But in general the
suggestion is to avoid it.

### Moving within a Site

The next block's adventure is to be moved from page to page.

The already familiar `Tabbed pane` block can be widely adopted. We can use it on
many pages. Of course, on a different page it has another parent block. As I've
said above, you should guarantee that it works correctly regardless of its
environment. This is what you achieve due to avoiding cascade.

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6426/14441195.26/0_711e3_3579af38_XL.jpg"
width="800" height="600" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5632/14441195.26/0_711e4_bf58fb79_XL.jpg"
width="800" height="600" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

Again, even if a block *now* is a single one within a whole site, that does not
mean it should depend on its surroundings.<br/>
The recommendation about avoiding cascade works for all the blocks.

#### Pages are Sets of Blocks
The other point is that when you are developing and maintaining, the block set of
every page changes.

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4122/14441195.26/0_711e5_77eb4431_XL.jpg"
width="800" height="491" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

We, developers, should think about keeping associated CSS in the actual state.
So that if a block was removed from a page, we should remove its CSS code. Also,
if a block was added to a page, we should ensure its CSS is linked there.<br/>
That is not a problem for sites of 2-3 pages since we can keep all the stuff in
a single one CSS file.<br/>
But usually life is not that easy; there are several pages that are different but
still have some common design solutions. At least the `Header` block is included in
all the pages.<br/>
So, developers usually place the common stuff into the `common.css` file.
Everything else is distributed per pages.

But let us look a bit closer to this practice.

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4137/14441195.26/0_711e6_bc435d6a_XL.jpg"
width="800" height="600" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

As you see in the picture, the `Header` block contains the `Search` block. This
design solution seems to be invariable within the whole site.

But not. The page providing advanced search form doesn't have this `Search` block
in the `Header`.

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4115/14441195.26/0_711e7_a1df577a_XL.jpg"
width="800" height="600" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

So, should we include the `Search` block code into `common.css` file? Seems like
shouldn't. Well, should we copy-paste it for all the other pages? Again, no.

Moreover, this is just a simple example. In the real life the variety of
interface object combinations indeed can be huge. Usually it is very hard to
define the common stuff.<br/>
On the other hand, copy paste is even worse.

So, there should be a way out.

<img
src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4122/14441195.26/0_711e5_77eb4431_XL.jpg"
width="800" height="491" title="" alt="" border="0"/>

What about turning these drawn sets of blocks into code?

You can store CSS code for every block separately, each in a file with a
corresponding name.

    blocks/
        header.css
        menu.css
        button.css
        tabbed-pane.css
        logo.css
        footer.css

So that, CSS for the `Menu` block is in the `menu.css` file, CSS for `Tabbed
Pane` block is the `tabbed-pane.css` file and so on.

Then, you can pack the CSS files for the pages with these blocks using an
`import` keyword.

````js
    @import url(blocks/header.css);
    @import url(blocks/menu.css);
    @import url(blocks/tabbed-pane.css);
    @import url(blocks/text.css);
    @import url(blocks/logo.css);
    @importurl(blocks/footer.css);
````

That enables you to take only what's necessary for a page.

As a result there is a block stack of our project, stored in a special folder.
And some pages that use these blocks.

Looks cool, but

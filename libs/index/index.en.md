## BEM libraries

### bem-core
[bem-core](http://bem.info/libs/bem-core/) is a core library, needed to start own BEM powered project. It provides sufficient number of blocks needed for client-side JavaScript coding and templating.

Main difference bettween bem-core and bem-bl is described in [migration guide](http://bem.info/libs/bem-core/1.1.0/migration/).

### bem-bl

[bem-bl](http://bem.github.io/bem-bl/index.en.html) is an extended library of blocks, that consists not only of basic blocks but also has a number of universal solutions to display a menu, text, logo, search tab, table, etc.

Current state of development: bem-bl is suspended and will not be filled with new blocks, however we provide user support and bug fixing. We recommend you to start new projects with bem-core instead of bem-bl.

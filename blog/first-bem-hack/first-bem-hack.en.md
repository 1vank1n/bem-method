# First Hackathon on BEM

Hi everyone,

First hackathon on BEM took place from Nov 14 to 16, 2014, in Moscow. It took us long to go from an idea to the actual 
realisation, and we would like to share our experience, results and plans with you.

## A little bit of history

We had an idea that we need something more than event to run for the sake of community building. An event to get our community 
together to discuss projects, difficulties that developers face, together think about the common solution.

A year and a half ago we started to move away from doing conferences and started to get together on small 
[BEMups]( https://events.yandex.ru/events/bemup/). We called our meetups so, and run already 6 of them in Moscow, 
Saint Petersburg, Minsk. Meetups gave us a lot: simple way of communication, meeting real people that use our technology, 
an option to get to know everyone in person, discuss real life problems in any other case, do not limit our time for 
questioning because of time limitations or a number of people.

We started to move away from talking towards coding, inviting more experienced developers, helping newcomers online making 
sure everyone is getting somewhere. As time went by we understood that we could go further on. Because the number of 
developers that can use BEM full stack is enough for a hackathon, and we finally could run it. We thought of projects 
and tasks, picked a date, opened a registration and pulled ourselves together. Even if it lead us nowhere, it would be a 
live experience, that we can use further on.

However, we were surprised!

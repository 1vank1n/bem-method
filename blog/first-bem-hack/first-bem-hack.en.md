# First Hackathon on BEM

Hi everyone,

First hackathon on BEM took place from Nov 14 to 16, 2014, in Moscow. It took us long to go from an idea to the actual 
realisation, and we would like to share our experience, results and plans with you.

## A little bit of history

We had an idea that we need something more than event to run for the sake of community building. An event to get our community 
together to discuss projects, difficulties that developers face, together think about the common solution.

A year and a half ago we started to move away from doing conferences and started to get together on small 
[BEMups]( https://events.yandex.ru/events/bemup/). We called our meetups so, and run already 6 of them in Moscow, 
Saint Petersburg, Minsk. Meetups gave us a lot: simple way of communication, meeting real people that use our technology, 
an option to get to know everyone in person, discuss real life problems in any other case, do not limit our time for 
questioning because of time limitations or a number of people.

We started to move away from talking towards coding, inviting more experienced developers, helping newcomers online making 
sure everyone is getting somewhere. As time went by we understood that we could go further on. Because the number of 
developers that can use BEM full stack is enough for a hackathon, and we finally could run it. We thought of projects 
and tasks, picked a date, opened a registration and pulled ourselves together. Even if it lead us nowhere, it would be a 
live experience, that we can use further on.

However, we were surprised!

## How we did it

Let me start from the format of hackathon we had, what logic we followed, task we thought up and how we did it.

We planned it for two days with an extra day prior and after — for getting to know each other and for departure. We welcomed participants the day before, on Friday, got to know each other, discussed our programm, showed around Yandex office, had dinner together in Yandex cantine and went home to get some rest before the event.

Saturday morning started for us pretty early, around 9a.m., with a breakfast in the venue, introduction into the projects (every mentor here presented his or her project in order to get participants join the team to work on tasks and do as much as possible) and forming the teams (every participant could choose only one team to join).

When we were done with that, we had 8 teams out of 12 projects presented that started to work on projects. They had a little bit more than 24 hours to code. Discussing tasks, deadlines, planing, preliminary results on an improvised kanban — we had it all. In every corner of our co-working space you could meet groups of people that were talking, creating schemes on blackboards, wrote code, sometimes went off to sleep a bit in the hammock room :)

Sunday after the lunch teams presented their projects and results of 2-days hackathon. The goal was to get maximum number of tasks to production level. Many teams finished their job on 75-80% done level, and we scheduled the publication of the results on [bem.info/blog](https://bem.info/blog).

Successful team work result was marked with books from [«Mann, Ivanov and Ferber»](http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/) publishing house, presents from Yandex, laughter, photos to keep memories alive and a dinner together!

Our main goal was not to compete for significant trophies but to work together on something that could commit to BEM community development and will help other projects. And we seemed to achieve that!

## What counts

We announced our hackathon 2,5 months prior to its execution. It is a long period of time to keep registration open. However we could not avoid it. We had to choose participants carefully, they had to prepare their own products on BEM or pass the test, we had to review code, ask for what is missing or start to communicate with potential participants. In other words, get them accepted, cover travel expences, sort out accomodation. Mentors of the projects had to think of the tasks and goals, plan the team work, suggest questions and find possible answers. We were not bored at all.

As the result, we had **34 calls for participation**. 23 invitations were sent after the review, 15 participants came to take part in the event. Five of them were not from Moscow but came from **Saint Petersburg, Orenburg, Voronezh, Ekaterinburg**. Our colleagues at Yandex were interested as well and came to code with us. 13 Yandex developers were in teams. We had **14 mentors** (some of the teams had two mentors at the same time), 4 of them were not from Yandex.

During our hackathon we have worked on the projects. **We had 12 projects**. 7 was created by BEM team, 
5 — by developers from BEM community.

After the introduction session we had 8 left to work on:

- Blocks
- Modular building of BEM projects
- Forum on BEM
- Dashboard
- Documentation
- A service that converts code into images with syntax highlighted written on BEM
- MaximeOnline: content management system on BEM
- BEM application for Smart-TV

How it was, what developers wanted to code and what they have got at the end will be written by mentors and published in our blog in the nearest future!

## Exit pull results

Once we are done with the event, we like to get developer's opinion on it. We value your meaning and constantly improve our events because of that.

We have got so called **exit pull results** on our hackathon too and would like to share it with you!

Thus, we have got mentors and participants both taking part in the survey in a proportion 40 to 60. **100% of answered felt satisfied** with their teams, mentors, participants. Little less than 100% were also satisfied with the level of preparation in the area of technology. So to speak, we have paid a lot of attention to the level of BEM and JS knowledge that participants have at registration because the project required to code not to learn JS.

We were worried however almost all teams passed planning period fast enough. They also planned tasks together as teams. At the end 80% of developers though of their work during hackathon as «realised everything we planned to code».

**Hackathon as a format** was found very comfortable and optimal. However there were developers that liked to start earlier or to sleep in the venue or to work more than two days or even not to leave it at all. We will listen to you definitely in the future!

This time most of the projects were created by our team. Therefore we wanted to find out whether participants find our ideas interesting and useful for realisation. 90% of those answered find them so. We are happy about that and will continue to bring our ideas and projects into BEM world!

Among the reasons that stopped teams from finishing were lack of technical skills of one or more team players, lack of time, risk of launching services on different platforms, not sufficient architecture planning, wrong estimation of  tasks complexity vs. team power.

**What would be great to solve in future events**:

- Train yourself beforehand in order no to stop the team
- Configure the environment beforehand in order not to stop the team
- Think of architecture beforehand in order not to stop the team
- Value the level of tasks given, needed quantity of people to solve them, deadlines; plan and split tasks into subtasks when needed in order not to stop the team
- Prepare projects with different levels of complexity — for beginners, to make something useful or to make it cool
- Code BEM full stack projects
- Vote for the ideas if there are too many, exclude unpopular to form teams of 5 developers for more productive realization of tasks
- Look for more community-driven projects

Some of answers are be worth quoting:

> «The main idea of any Hackathon is to have this atmosphere of creativeness and healthy competition. Therefore would be great to have more original projects from the community».

> «I mush say that prescreening of developers' skills was good enough and there was no need to explain BEM anymore.  Ideal situation was in Blocks team: every block is a separate task, project is already configured, there are examples of of other blocks and a format. As a result everyone had a task according to his skills and completed it before the presentation. Of course one solid task is much more interesting than several small but having 8-10 hours of pure time this will be ideal».

> «We should send at least one BEM-friend in any project we have. There were teams lacking people from BEM-team/Yandex. And it was hard enough to code and to answer questions at the same time».

> «We need to have more independent projects in the future. Similar to what developers from "Pictures" team did».

> «BEM Hackathon was supercool! However, I think we should have less blocks oriented projects. I think that people who is not that deep into BEM, they are not interested in projects like bem-ide or building tools :(»

> «I am a hackathon nymphomaniac. I love to hack and can do nothing with it. ^_______^»

However, we have not only positive comments. **Two developers were sad** about some parts and we would like to adress this to them.

One complain that there was a project the essence of which was not clear from the presentation and that the mentor of this project spent two days doing nothing. The result showed nothing as well. He advises us to avoid such projects in the future. And we agree. We will stop such intentions in the future. For the first time we were hoping that developers were more respectfull and interested to help the community, and that rulles we declared are for everyone — «if there were none to join your team, and you will not be able to finish your project in time during these two days, you should team up with the others to help them finish». After few reminders, questions and advises to join the others we gave up and tried not to push these guys and see what will happen. This will not happen again.

Another wrote us that "there was sad enough situation: only two teams outside of Yandex that were trying to code something and got 0 on voting". He suggested that we had to support them somehow. In his point of view, ideas were ok, but there were no technical skills and marketing. He also think that blocks and existing project development are strange ideas fot a hackathon".

And here we fully disagree. Our hackathon was a project for the community where we could code together and opensource projects helping other BEM-developers. Half of 8 projects was exactly about it — Blocks (that needed by everyone), Building (modules for external building tools to build BEM-projects comfortably), Documentation (for the technologies that everyone use) and Forum (through which we communicate). These teams got the most of participants from the community. They were followed by 4 external projects — Dashboard, Pictures, Maxim Online and SmartTV.

According to the [voting results](http://instagram.com/p/vdvuzDjYhP/?modal=true) Dashboard got the first place with 11 votes,  Pictures got the 4th place together with Documentation team. Maxim Online and SmartTV got 0. It is unpleasant indeed, but not biased. The results that these teams presented were palpably lower than the others. We wish these teams next time to concentrate on better planning and better presenting, or to join other teams. It has sense — you will know more, will train your skills, will do better for the community, will bring efficiency to the project.

We had no prizes for hackathon. While planning we thought that **our idea of making BEM world better** will drive us. Do you think the same way? Answers say that you do. Many said that they could code without prizes because they are happy to commit or that promotional prizes are enough. However, we will try to encourage you more in the future.

Thank you so much for the ideas and that you came to our hackathon!

We were very happy that the majority valued

- Skills and experience exchange
- Ability to write blocks correctly
- Get skills fast enough during their work on hackathon and from experienced developers
- Get to know each other
- Find answers on their BEM questions and commit to BEM development
- Find necessary information about further development and plans
- Go deeper into the community and make contacts
- Take part in real BEM projects
- Observe how the others deal with hackathon
- Learn how to manage working process

Somebody wrote us that "he learnt to find answers about i-bem.js, tried to write tests, got useful comments on codestyle, learnt to notice things that thought unnecessary before. Because of hackathon he understood finally what needed to be improved and defined his professional direction for the next one to two years. Got a lot of benefits. Finished his part even though it was a biut small for the experienced developers".

And that is cool!

A lot more posts on hackathon results are coming soon. Our [photostory](http://bit.ly/bem-hack-photo) is already published.

Do not switch and **Stay BEMed**!

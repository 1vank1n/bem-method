# First Hackathon on BEM

Hi everyone,

First hackathon on BEM took place from Nov 14 to 16, 2014, in Moscow. It took us long to go from an idea to the actual 
realisation, and we would like to share our experience, results and plans with you.

## A little bit of history

We had an idea that we need something more than event to run for the sake of community building. An event to get our community 
together to discuss projects, difficulties that developers face, together think about the common solution.

A year and a half ago we started to move away from doing conferences and started to get together on small 
[BEMups]( https://events.yandex.ru/events/bemup/). We called our meetups so, and run already 6 of them in Moscow, 
Saint Petersburg, Minsk. Meetups gave us a lot: simple way of communication, meeting real people that use our technology, 
an option to get to know everyone in person, discuss real life problems in any other case, do not limit our time for 
questioning because of time limitations or a number of people.

We started to move away from talking towards coding, inviting more experienced developers, helping newcomers online making 
sure everyone is getting somewhere. As time went by we understood that we could go further on. Because the number of 
developers that can use BEM full stack is enough for a hackathon, and we finally could run it. We thought of projects 
and tasks, picked a date, opened a registration and pulled ourselves together. Even if it lead us nowhere, it would be a 
live experience, that we can use further on.

However, we were surprised!

## How we did it

Let me start from the format of hackathon we had, what logic we followed, task we thought up and how we did it.

We planned it for two days with an extra day prior and after — for getting to know each other and for departure. We welcomed participants the day before, on Friday, got to know each other, discussed our programm, showed around Yandex office, had dinner together in Yandex cantine and went home to get some rest before the event.

Saturday morning started for us pretty early, around 9a.m., with a breakfast in the venue, introduction into the projects (every mentor here presented his or her project in order to get participants join the team to work on tasks and do as much as possible) and forming the teams (every participant could choose only one team to join).

When we were done with that, we had 8 teams out of 12 projects presented that started to work on projects. They had a little bit more than 24 hours to code. Discussing tasks, deadlines, planing, preliminary results on an improvised kanban — we had it all. In every corner of our co-working space you could meet groups of people that were talking, creating schemes on blackboards, wrote code, sometimes went off to sleep a bit in the hammock room :)

Sunday after the lunch teams presented their projects and results of 2-days hackathon. The goal was to get maximum number of tasks to production level. Many teams finished their job on 75-80% done level, and we scheduled the publication of the results on [bem.info/blog](https://bem.info/blog).

Successful team work result was marked with books from [«Mann, Ivanov and Ferber»](http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/) publishing house, presents from Yandex, laughter, photos to keep memories alive and a dinner together!

Our main goal was not to compete for significant trophies but to work together on something that could commit to BEM community development and will help other projects. And we seemed to achieve that!
